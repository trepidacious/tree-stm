## Ids

### STM ids.
 * Globally unique (with high probability) would be useful
 * NOT secure - may be easy to guess, having one cannot be used as permission to view it (need additional permissions layer for this)
 * Not ordered
 * Probably not great for database key
 * Colour/pattern/text hash to allow user-visible difference between items

Just use UUIDS? Need to look at generation, ideally can be repeatably generated by client, implies PRNG seeded from transaction context (so time and transaction id - additional data could be used as long as it is sent through with transaction for server to reuse). Intent here is just to avoid collision by poor seed, not to make this secure. Could check guid is unique on server side fairly easily, thus completely avoiding collisions but requiring us to send the altered guid back to client. 

### Transaction ids
 * Don't need to be globally unique, just unique to server.
 * NOT secure - very easy to guess
 * Ordered (incrementing index for clients, transaction on client)
 * Should just be an implementation detail? Used to check whether transaction is local or remote to a client.
 * Used to seed GUID generation on client? We would know we don't have this part of the seed the same between different any pair of transactions.
 * Not to be used in database ids?
